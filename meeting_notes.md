# Meeting Notes

## Week 1
### Questions
- Scope of lattice surgery exploration?
- What is meant by novel memory allocation techniques and do we need it?

### Decisions
- Using Godot with gdscript

### Meeting with Sean
- Lattice surgery
    - single, 2-qubit operations, merge and seperation of 2 logical qubits on the grid
    - Using stim will simplify things

- Novem Memory Allocation
    - for a full plane, where do you store all the logical qubits?  
        - how to allocate these qubits so that we can do the least amount of operations, to do the least amount of work for moving around
        - distance 3 and 5 logical qubits, moving them
    - exploration but doesnt need to be a full-fledged thing

- Updates to the problem statement
    - find and cite comparable studies
    - add communcation to the purpose statement
    - Value -- add these:
        - process of simulating surface codes
        - visualizing surface codes
    - Between phase 2-3:
        - how to represent a quantum information, stabilizers, and show what happened
    - For the tutorial phase, figure out how to do the tutorials
    - Add phase for multiple logical qubits after the simulation phase - as well as lattice surgery on multiple qubits and the memory allocation
