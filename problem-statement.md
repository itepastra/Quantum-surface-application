# Problem Statement

## Requirements

- Have a visual grid with interactive qubits
    - Be able to add/remove qubits from the lattice including defects
    - Be able to change the state of qubits
    - Be able to add X and Z stabilizers
    - Dynamically create logical qubits
- Be able to display and interact with this grid on a website
- Be able to calculate the hamming distance of the logical qubits
- Simulate errors occuring and let the user see the result to understand the error
    - Show syndome measurement in an intuitive manner
- Add a tutorial mechanism (all visual/interactive first)
    - Explain controls
    - Explain what a qubit can be
    - Explain what a stabilizer does
    - Show a surface code with stabilizers
    - Explain syndome decoding
- The simulation needs to run on the client
- Have a toggle to see "what is going on underneath"
