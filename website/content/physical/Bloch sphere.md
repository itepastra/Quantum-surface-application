In this app, weâ€™ve focused on the six most significant qubit states,the cardinal states, each represented by a distinct color, as described in the "Qubit" subsection. In reality, however, a qubit is not limited to just these six states. In the quantum world, it can exist in any superposition of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, which corresponds to a point anywhere on a sphere known as the Bloch sphere.

Below, you can see how a quantum state is precisely mapped onto the Bloch sphere, alongside the six cardinal states used in our simulation, with their corresponding colors. The visualization also shows the X, Y, and Z axes, which align with these states, giving a clear picture of how qubit states are oriented in this geometric representation.
