We've been working on an interactive application to learn about Quantum Error Correction (QEC) and some
other basic Quantum Computing concepts. 
If you want to learn about how to control the application but already understand how QEC works
it may be useful to skip ahead to the [controls](@/sandbox/controls.md).
Otherwise, look through the other pages and figure out how the simulator works while learning how
various Quantum Computing concepts are described by it in a way that we hope is understandable.
