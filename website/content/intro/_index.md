On this website we'll try to explain everything you might need to understand what lattice surgery is.
We start by explaining the necessary parts of a physical qubit, followed by
how gates can influence this qubit or even two at once.
Then we go into how stabilizers allow for quantum error correction codes to form logical qubits
and finally we will show how two logical qubits can interact by merging and splitting again.

All these words might seem daunting, but we'll explain all of them in the following chapters.
We also include a simulation for you to play with and tasks that'll hopefully make you understand better.
